Hello, I'm showfhon. A sophomore in NSYSU EE.
((Currently struggling with my major..... so many things to learn :(

I just started to learn some coding skill few weeks ago.
Have finished C++ course in my college but still understand nothing about programming.
So now I try to study it on my own in my free time.
Hope I can make some progress in this semester.

Currently learning - HTML/CSS/Javascript I guess
