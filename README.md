Hello, I'm showfhon. A freshman in NSYSU EE.

I just started to learn some coding skill recently.
Have finished C++ course in my college this spring but still understand nothing about programming.
So now I try to study it on my own in my free time.
Hope I can make some progress before the next semester begin.

Currently learning - HTML/CSS/Javascript I guess
